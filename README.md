# Chat-app

This chat was created using only python. This chat allows a certain numbers of users to connect , it is going to depend on the number of users that you define.
To use this app you must have python 3.5 or above.


### To Run
To run the server you have to run the server.py module and to run the client you can use the test.py module.
I created the test.py because i dont have a front-end for this app but you can create your own front-end and use the client.py module for the  to connect to your front-end client.
